## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive comments for each ignore pattern section
- Group related ignore patterns together (e.g., Terraform files, environment files)
- Use consistent indentation and spacing
- Follow the existing section structure with descriptive headers
- Keep patterns specific and well-documented
- Use `**/` for recursive directory patterns where appropriate
- Order patterns logically from general to specific

## File Structure
